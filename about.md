h3 Nayeon Kwon
  I majored Korean language and literature in undergraduate and got master's degree in English Education.<br>
I studied how students learn a new language in a view of statistical learning and motor recognition.<br>
Now I am in the between of master's and higher education in Cognition associated research field.<br>
This blog is mainly for `the study notes with regard to Cognitive Science issues and Methodologies`.<br>
Also, personal reviews are posted related to a wide range of books, films, other productions around me.
<br>
<br>
### Researches
My research interests are *language acquisition and processing, perceptual learning, emotion or heuristics.*<br>
I conducted ERP experiments about *L2 speech perception depending on foreign accents*.<br>
I'd like to keep studying Human's perception and the elements influencing the perception processing such as emotion, information or else.<br>   
I am also interested in *Data Processing - statistics, machine learning etc.* in a variety of methological windows.<br>
Conducting researches using R, Python, SPSS, EEGlab, BrainStorm, Psychopy, Presentation, BrainVision EEG systems, etc.
